    <p>Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man— what's in it for the Dude? Jesus, man, can you change the station? All right, Plan B. You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry. And Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And Donny too. Donny who… who loved bowling.</p>

    <p>Would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. …which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide—but sometimes there's a man… sometimes there's a man.</p>

    <p>How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? Near the In-and-Out Burger. You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me. My name's Da Fino! I'm a private snoop! Like you, man! Ja, it seems you forgot our little deal, Lebowski. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude.</p>

    <p>Yes sir. It is our most modestly priced receptacle. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut. But that is up to little Larry here. Isn't it, Larry? Are they gonna hurt us, Walter? When will you find these guys? I mean, do you have any promising leads? I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON! That wasn't her toe.</p>

    <p>I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous—on a personal level. Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski! Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate. This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled. Yeah man, it really tied the room together. Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacifists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.</p>

    <p>Huh? Oh. Yeah. Tape deck. Couple of Creedence tapes. And there was a, uh… my briefcase. Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus. Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski. LOGJAMMIN'. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography. A fifteen-year-old? Is this your idea of a joke? WE HAVE BUNNY. GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. NO FUNNY STUFF.</p>

    <p>Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together. Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? I know my rights. Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. His girlfriend gafe up her toe! She sought we'd be getting million dollars! Iss not fair! You know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.</p>

    <p>I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug. I got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet. Mein nommen iss Karl. Is hard to verk in zese clozes. Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?</p>

    <p>Over the line! I hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug, which, I assure you, is not a problem. Wait in the car, Donny. Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Uh, yeah. Probably a vagrant, slept in the car. Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on. No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police.</p>

    <p>Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters, ups and downs. My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong? A man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson". This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.</p>

    <p>A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.</p>

    <p>Who's in pyjamas, Walter? This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is—are you ready for this? —Arthur Digby Sellers. …and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that—quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. They won't hurt us, Donny. These men are cowards. Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands. Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.</p>

    <p>No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, you know, this aggression will not stand, man. Leads, yeah. I'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts. Nice marmot. Zere ARE no ROOLZ! Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.</p>

    <p>I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski. Say friend, ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla? You know, little of this, little of that. D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? Look, Larry… Have you ever heard of Vietnam? Whose toe was it, Walter? Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head.</p>

    <p>You think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff? I—the royal we, man, you know, the editorial. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous. Tomorrow vee come back und cut off your chonson. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides. To use the parlance of our times. Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.</p>

    <p>Our basic freedoms. They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold —wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.</p>

    <p>Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour. Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle. Obviously you're not a golfer. Goodnight, sweet prince. Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man. And thorough. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway.</p>

    <p>They were Nazis, Dude? That had not occurred to us, Dude. 1972 Pontiac LeBaron. Do you have any kalhua? DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY? Strong men also cry… Strong men also cry. He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.</p>

    <p>You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Thankie… Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? Dieter has been on the fringes of —well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'. Is this your homework, Larry? Vee belief in nossing. One a those days, huh. Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.</p>

    <p>I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC and bowling. No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. Your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies. So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent… of half a million… fifty grand.</p>
